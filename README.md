# Library-Management-system-Python-
Library Management system with Python (no GUI *yet*)

This type of management uses 2 scv tables:
1 for Books in general and 1 for books that are borrowed

Header for Books in general:
Title	Author	Genre	SubGenre	Height	Publisher	Id	Status
Header for Books that are borrowed:
Title	Id	From	 To	
         (date) (date)
For books examples i used : https://gist.github.com/jaidevd/23aef12e9bf56c618c41 and added 'Id'
Thank you @jaidevd!
